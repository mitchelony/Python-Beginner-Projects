***Hi Guys! My name is Mitchel and I'm currently a Freshman studying computer science.***

I have some experience with coding but nothing substantial.

This is a repository of beginner-level projects I complete while learning Python programming fundamentals.
The projects cover many basic topics and require some proficiency to complete.

While doing this I discovered that the best and the most technical projects were always apps or games due to the need for an understanding of algorithms.
it has been quite a journey though and I would love to continue down this path.

PS. I have no idea how to use GitHub
