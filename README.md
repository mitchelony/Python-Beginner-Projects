Hi Guys! My name is Mitchel and I'm currently a Freshman studying computer science.
I have some experience with coding but nothing substantial.
This is a repository of beginner-level projects that I complete while learning the fundamentals of Python programming.
The Proprojs cover a wide range of basic topics and require some proficiency to complete.
While doing this i discovered that the best and the most technical projects were always apps or games due to the need of understanind of algorithms.
it has bee quitne a un journey though and i wouId love to continue down this path.
